Our project is an active lens diagram generator. You will be able to adjust the object distance, object height, concave vs convex lens, and focal length and watch the light vectors and image vector respond to these changes. Numbers will be displayed as well. Will zoom in and zoom out based on image height and distance relative to lens. Users who are logged in will have their sessions actively saved with each change. The session is sharable for users who are logged in through the link.  These diagrams will also be able to be downloaded as images.
