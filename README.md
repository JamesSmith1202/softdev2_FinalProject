Our project is a website that allows many people to listen to music together and create playlists collaboratively. It will be divided into rooms that people can join and listen to the music being streamed from Youtube. Users may create their own rooms where they can make it a private room with a passcode or a public room where anyone can join. Users may join rooms from a shareable link or from a search page. Once in a room, users can submit music to the room playlist which will just be a Youtube track link. Once submitted, it will be next in the queue and it will be added to a public Youtube playlist that users can save to their actual Youtube account. If the music room runs out of new songs in the queue, it will shuffle songs in the playlist that has been constructed from all user submissions. Users will be able to add rooms to their favorites list to go back and find later.
